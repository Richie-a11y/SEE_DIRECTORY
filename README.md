Code Explanation
The code is straightforward and includes comments to explain each step:

It uses the input() function to get numbers from the user.

float() is used to convert the input strings into floating-point numbers, allowing for decimals.

Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) are used for calculations.

f-strings are used to format and print the results clearly.
